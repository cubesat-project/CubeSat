INTERFACE: Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)

MECHANICAL INTERFACES:
-- Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS))

%% Here is where you describe your mechanical interface. Provide information on materials and type of fastener. Provide information on mass, volume, and centre of mass of unit. Provide information on thermal constraints. If any are unknown, state that they are unknown (as that will be your future action item).

-- MECHANICAL (Spirit & Opportunity)
  - We will be using 3 gyroscopes along each axis for attitude determination during an eclipse:
	- Material composition:
	- Type of fastener:
	- Mass: 0.3g
  - We will also be using a magnetometer for attitude determination when using the gyroscopes:
    	- Material composition:
	- Type of fastener:
	- Mass:
  - We will also be using a sun sensor for attitude determination during normal operation:
    	- Material composition: 
	- Type of fastener: 3x M2 threaded holes
	- Mass: < 5g
  - We will be using 3 magnetorquers for attitude control:
   	 - Material composition:
	- Type of fastener: Tied directly to PCB
	- Mass: < 30g

%% Here, the mechanical team acknowledges the interface / requests specific information / highlights any conflicts. In the case of the ADCS or OBDH subsystem, BOTH mechanical teams must acknowledge the interface.

DATA INTERFACES:
-- Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)
	- Description of data interface:
	- Physical data connector:
	- Estimated data rate:
	- Description of required software commands (for example, does your unit broadcast status values once per minute, or does a request have to be sent to your unit to send that status? Does your unit require an instruction to switch on and then switch off? Does your unit have multiple components that each require individual instructions?):
